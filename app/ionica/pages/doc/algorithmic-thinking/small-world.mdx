# Small World

Sometimes we hear the phrase `The World is small`. It means that people know
each other directly, or by just a few connections. A similar situation can
occur in computer networks. We can ask how many connections are between two
nodes.

The `Small World` phenomena can help us answer many questions. For example,
we can analyze the spread of an infection by analyzing the connections of
humans.


## 1. Problem 1: Is freindship transitive?

1.1. Identify the problem from a domain expert.
  > A social scientist may ask if friendship has a transitive property.
  In other words, if person A is friends with person B, and person B is friends with person C,
  is person A also freinds with person C?

1.2. Model the input and output
  > We can model the input as a graph. The nodes being the user accounts and the edges
  representing friendship relations. The output should be a scalar `q` that quantifies
  the transitivity.

  ```mermaid
  graph LR;
      0 --- 1 --- 2;
      3 --- 4;
  ```

| node | node | distance |
| ---  | ---  | ---      |
|    0 |    1 |        1 |
|    0 |    2 |        2 |
|    0 |    3 |      inf |
|    0 |    4 |      inf |
|    1 |    0 |        1 |
|    1 |    2 |        1 |
|    1 |    3 |      inf |

... and so on.
  
1.3. Design the algorithm
  > Pseudo-code is a simplified, language-agnostic way to describe an
  algorithm's logic.

  $$
  X \larr \text{smallest element of } L_{j}
  $$

1.4. Implement the algorithm

1.5. Run the algorithm on the data and answer the original question
